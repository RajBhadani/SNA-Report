## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the report titled **"Applications of Social Network Analysis in Public Health and Security"**, which explores how **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** can be applied to:

- Strengthen **multisectoral public health governance**
- Monitor and amplify **online public discourse**
- Uncover **covert relationships in terrorist networks**

The report synthesizes real-world case studies to show how SNA metrics like **centrality**, **density**, and **betweenness** can reveal influential actors and hidden patterns across diverse sectors.
